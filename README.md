# Book Summarization

This Python script provides a way to summarize a book using various natural language processing techniques and libraries. It follows a step-by-step process to generate a summary from the book text.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have the following libraries installed:

- gensim
- sumy
- langchain
- spacy
- transformers

You can install these libraries using pip:

```shell
pip install gensim sumy langchain spacy transformers
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Steps
The script follows these steps to generate the summary:

Import the necessary libraries.
Load the book text from a file into a string variable.
Preprocess the text using spaCy:
Remove stop words and punctuation.
Lemmatize the tokens.
Use Gensim to create a document-term matrix.
Apply Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) or Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to the document-term matrix to identify topics.
Use TextRank or LexRank from the sumy library to generate a summary based on the identified topics.
Use BERT or GPT-2 from the transformers library to refine the summary.
Use Langchain to further refine the summary.
Output the final summary to a file named "summary.txt" and also display it in the console.
Usage
Place the book text file in the same directory as the script and name it "book.txt".
